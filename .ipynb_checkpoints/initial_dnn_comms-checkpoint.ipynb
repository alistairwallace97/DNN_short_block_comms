    "- Changed the normalisation to use the BatchNormalization function <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "07/02/2019\n",
    "- Changed the batch size, increased the data size and changed the axis along which BatchRegularization was done\n",
    "- The results were very inconsistent, reading suggested this might be to do with the ReLu activation function giving dependence on initialisation values due to neuron death.\n",
    "- Consequently tried a leaky-relu activation function\n",
    "- Found a bug that one layer was being bypassed\n",
    "- Switched back to original regularisation layer but over a different axis.\n",
    "- Decided it makes sense to use an l2 regulariser as that reflects a transmitter with a constant power budget\n",
    "- Named all layers so that weights could be loaded from one layer into another\n",
    "- Plotted BLER graph for (2,2) case\n",
    "- Started implementing hamming encoding\n",

    "08/02/2019\n",
    "- Changed the constellation diagram plot to match the O'Shea paper's format.\n",
    "\n",
    "13/02/2019\n",
    "- Added hard decision Hamming encoding and decoding\n",
    "- Added BPSK encoding and decoding\n",

    "- Compared four activation functions to see which one had the best verification error.\n",
    "\n",
    "6-12/05/2019\n",
    "- Compared the leaky-relu activation function against the tanh activation function and found it marginally outperformed it, therefore proceeded from then on with the tanh activation function.\n",
    "- Made a (7,4) autoencoder model and compared it's performance against the others.\n",
    "- Used t-SNE to get constellation diagrams for the (7,4) model, both with and without noise. \n",
    "- Found the t-SNE method of dimensionality reduction introduces some randomness and so the constellation diagram is slightly different each time.\n",
    "- Had to normalise the outputs of the t-SNE dimensionality reduction to zero-mean and unit power, despite it's input being stationary satisfying the afore-mentioned conditions.\n",
    "- Developed (2,2) and (8,8) BPSK, compared these against each other and against the other encoding methods.\n",
    "- Produced Figure's 3a and 3b from the O'Shea paper, however the ordering of the capabilities of the encoding methods is not in the right order. The (8,8) and (7,4) autoencoders underperform, and BPSK over performs.\n",
    "    - The ordering is odd, I would expect it to be from best to worst: (7,4), (2,2), (8,8). But it is actually currently: (2,2), (7,4), (8,8).\n",
    "    - I have yet to find out what Hamming Maximum Likelihood Decision is.\n",
    "- Decided that the reason the (8,8) and (7,4) models might be underperforming may be because of a lack of layers, so tried increasing the number of layers and making the final layer of each block have a tanh activation funciton to try and capture non-linearity.\n",

    "13/05/2019\n",
    "- I realised that my 8_8 was actually and 8_4, so I've adjusted that and I'm retraining the model to see what kind of validation_loss it gets. The best 8_4 accuracy found was 1.06, an initial re-training with no tapering gave a val_loss of 0.0750.\n",

    "    - Yet to test their performances, they're still training.\n",
    "- Realised that the (7,4) model was being unfairly normalised. The (8,8) and (2,2) models are normalised so that they have unit power for each complex channel symbol. Whereas the (7,4) model is being normalised so that it has unit power for all 7 bits. So I need to multiply all the values post normalisation by sqrt(3.5) to make it even.\n",
