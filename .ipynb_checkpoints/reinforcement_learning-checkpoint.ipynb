    "##### Notes from paper\n",
    "- Loss function = Cross Entropy\n",
    "- Normalisation = Average L2 power constraint = 1. $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{N}\\left\\Vert x\\right\\Vert_2^2\\right]$ = 1.\n",
    "- Trained at an SNR of 10dB for AWGN and an SNR of 20dB for RBF channel. $\\sigma_{\\pi}^2$ = 0.02 at training time.\n",
    "    - During RL exploration $\\mathbf{x_p} = \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{w}$, where each element of $\\mathbf{w}$ is i.i.d ~ $\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma_{\\pi}^2)$\n",
    "- M= 256, N=4. N= the number of complex channel uses, so n = 8. Therefore n,k = (8,8)\n",
    "- AWGN -> 1 hidden layer, size M, ReLu activation function\n",
    "- Rayleigh -> see diagram.\n",
    "    - Two layers (Dense(20,tanh)->Dense(2,linear)) calculate an estimate for $\\hat{h}$, then we divide the received signal by $\\hat{h}$ then have two layers for finding the received signal. Dense(M,ReLu) then Dense(M,Softmax). Then have the select maximum likelihood symbol layer.\n",
    "- SNR $ = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{N}\\left\\Vert x\\right\\Vert_2^2\\right]}{\\sigma^2}$, but because of the normalisation this is $\\frac{1}{\\sigma^2}$.\n",
    "- The RBF seems to be slow fading, but I could check for fast fading as well. Rayleigh fading is of the form $\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{s}*\\mathbf{h} + \\mathbf{n}$ where $\\mathbf{h}$ ~ $\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma_m^2)$, $\\mathbf{n}$ ~ $\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma_a^2)$. \n",
    "    - Slow fading: h stays the same across the whole minibatch\n",
    "    - Fast fading: h changes every sample\n",
    "- I'm going to guess that $\\sigma_m ~ \\frac{1}{3}$. Because this means that 98% of the time it's less than 1. Which sounds alright.\n",
    "- I could also try Ricean fading and see how the model performs against that.\n",
    "- Ricean fading would actually be the most general, as then it could learn Rayleigh fading, and it could also learn AWGN just by learning to make $\\hat{h}$ every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Work Log\n",
    "\n",
    "27/05/2019\n",
    "- Started researching RBF, think I can implement it in a custom layer.\n",
    "- Made lots of notes\n",
    "- Copied over functions from other notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "28/05/2019\n",
    "- Made functions for making the Tx and Rx blocks for the unsupervised learning, however these will likely need to be edited.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "29/05/2019\n",
    "- Got food poisoning the night before and did no work.\n",
    "\n",
    "31/05/2019\n",
    "- Got the rbf supervised model fitting, but with no good results. \n",
    "- Copied the architecture from the paper exactly, however it was not effective. This involved:\n",
    "    - Adding layers for complex multiplication and division.\n",
    "    - Adding layers for seperately finding the $\\hat{h}$ as an expert feature.\n",
    "    - Adding a custom layer that added rbf fast fading \n",
    "- Initially I set the $sigma_m$ to 0.33, for the reasons laid out above, but the model wasn't making any progress training. So after some research I found it written online somewhere that it is often set to $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ to give unity fading gain on average. This seems wrong as you should expect to lose power in the channel. However, upon trying this the model trained vastly more successfully so I may stick with this, or train at a higher SNR if I don't use this.\n",
    "- Going to try debugging it for a while, then I may try using different numbers of layers and activation functions to try and get the two supervised lines in Figures 6a and 6b from the Aoudia and Hoydis paper. After this I can try and get the reinforcement learned lines giving the same results. \n",
    "\n",
    "03/06/2019\n",
    "- Converting the interim report into the introduction and background sections of the final report. Also writing the abstract.\n",
    "\n",
    "04/06/2019\n",
    "- Fixed the average power normalisation\n",
    "- Continued converting the interim report into the start of a final report.\n",
    "- Found that the model had very significant gains if I trained it with $sigma_a = 0$, investigating whether this could be an effective way of training the $\\hat{h}$ estimation section of the model more quickly so it could then go on to learning the additive noise section later. However this is not how it would be able to work in a normal channel.\n",
    "    - On this subject it was found that the model hardly learnt anything in an RBF channel at 20db of SNR. So 40db was trialled which was more successful, but still trained extremely slowly. This is how no noise was trielled, which gave extremely fast reduction of validation loss.\n",
    "    \n",
    "05/06/2019\n",
    "- Got supervised AWGN graph for a range of SNRs.\n",
    "- Converted interim report into the first two sections of the final report. Adapted Implementation Plan, Evaluation Plan sections and moved Safety, Ethical and Legal plan into the appendix.\n",
    "- Trained supervised_rbf_sa40 for 100 epochs locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "06/06/2019\n",
    "- Added parallel for using joblib for the sweeping across SNRs\n",
    "- Tried running the best supervised_rbf_sa40 model over a range of SNRs, it gave an alright shaped curve but with error rates varying from 0.99 to 0.92, so absurdly high.\n",
    "\n",
    "07/06/2019\n",
    "- Tried out a few different combinations of activation functions\n",
    "- Wrote a function for making a general model with variable numbers of layers and activation functions.\n",
    "- Found out that rayleigh block fading has the same $\\hat{h}$ for the whole block, what I have been doing so far is \"*slow rayleigh fading*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "8-13/06/2019\n",
    "- Wrote most of the report\n",
    "\n",
    "15/06/2019\n",
    "- Tried to make a RBF autoencoder. Got it having non-zero gradients, but it couldn't see the weights of the individual transmitters and receivers. Also it took prohibitively long for block sizes of ~1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### To do\n",
    "- Investigate BCH codes, see how long I think it would take to implement one. \n",

    "- Switched to a more functional way of assembling the model.\n",
    "    - Isolated it to it being a problem of the multiple input to the receiver block.\n",

    "    - It worked!!!\n",
    "    - Added back in all the transmitter blocks, took a while.\n",
    "    - Tidied up code to get rid of all random commented out code.\n",

    "    - Must be the combination of the y_over_h and the receiver block together, but why???\n",
