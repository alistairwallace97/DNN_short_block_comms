# DNN_short_block_comms
Redesigning Communication systems with short block lengths using DNNs

This is my final year project, I will be starting by replicating the results of two papers of the few papers on this subject, both of which have come out this year. After this I will be attempting to tackle the problems which are currently limiting this technology.
