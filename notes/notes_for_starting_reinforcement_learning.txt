Notes from re-reading paper 3
-----------------------------

Training a NN-based transmitter using a policy gradient was explored in [12].
(C. de Vrieze, S. Barratt, D. Tsai, and A. Sahai, “Cooperative multi-
agent reinforcement learning for low-level wireless communication,”
arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.04541, Jan. 2018.)
I should look in here in case they have a github or anything.
