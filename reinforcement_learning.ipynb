    "##### Notes from paper\n",
    "- Loss function = Cross Entropy\n",
    "- Normalisation = Average L2 power constraint = 1. $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{N}\\left\\Vert x\\right\\Vert_2^2\\right]$ = 1.\n",
    "- Trained at an SNR of 10dB for AWGN and an SNR of 20dB for RBF channel. $\\sigma_{\\pi}^2$ = 0.02 at training time.\n",
    "    - During RL exploration $\\mathbf{x_p} = \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{w}$, where each element of $\\mathbf{w}$ is i.i.d ~ $\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma_{\\pi}^2)$\n",
    "- M= 256, N=4. N= the number of complex channel uses, so n = 8. Therefore n,k = (8,8)\n",
    "- AWGN -> 1 hidden layer, size M, ReLu activation function\n",
    "- Rayleigh -> see diagram.\n",
    "    - Two layers (Dense(20,tanh)->Dense(2,linear)) calculate an estimate for $\\hat{h}$, then we divide the received signal by $\\hat{h}$ then have two layers for finding the received signal. Dense(M,ReLu) then Dense(M,Softmax). Then have the select maximum likelihood symbol layer.\n",
    "- SNR $ = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{N}\\left\\Vert x\\right\\Vert_2^2\\right]}{\\sigma^2}$, but because of the normalisation this is $\\frac{1}{\\sigma^2}$.\n",
    "- The RBF seems to be slow fading, but I could check for fast fading as well. Rayleigh fading is of the form $\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{s}*\\mathbf{h} + \\mathbf{n}$ where $\\mathbf{h}$ ~ $\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma_m^2)$, $\\mathbf{n}$ ~ $\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma_a^2)$. \n",
    "    - Slow fading: h stays the same across the whole minibatch\n",
    "    - Fast fading: h changes every sample\n",
    "- I'm going to guess that $\\sigma_m ~ \\frac{1}{3}$. Because this means that 98% of the time it's less than 1. Which sounds alright.\n",
    "- I could also try Ricean fading and see how the model performs against that.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Work Log\n",
    "\n",
    "27/05/2019\n",
    "- Started researching RBF, think I can implement it in a custom layer.\n",
    "- Made lots of notes\n",
    "- Copied over functions from other notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "28/05/2019\n",
    "- Made functions for making the Tx and Rx blocks for the unsupervised learning, however these will likely need to be edited.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "29/05/2019\n",
    "- Got food poisoning the night before and did no work.\n",
    "\n",
    "31/05/2019\n",
    "- Got the rbf supervised model fitting, but with no good results. \n",
    "- Copied the architecture from the paper exactly, however it was not effective. This involved:\n",
    "    - Adding layers for complex multiplication and division.\n",
    "    - Adding layers for seperately finding the $\\hat{h}$ as an expert feature.\n",
    "    - Adding a custom layer that added rbf fast fading \n",
    "- Initially I set the $sigma_m$ to 0.33, for the reasons laid out above, but the model wasn't making any progress training. So after some research I found it written online somewhere that it is often set to $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ to give unity fading gain on average. This seems wrong as you should expect to lose power in the channel. However, upon trying this the model trained vastly more successfully so I may stick with this, or train at a higher SNR if I don't use this.\n",
    "- Going to try debugging it for a while, then I may try using different numbers of layers and activation functions to try and get the two supervised lines in Figures 6a and 6b from the Aoudia and Hoydis paper. After this I can try and get the reinforcement learned lines giving the same results. \n",
    "\n",
    "03/06/2018\n",
    "- Converting the interim report into the introduction and background sections of the final report. Also writing the abstract.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### To do\n",
    "- Work out why the average power constraint is giving a power per symbol of 0.25.\n",
    "- Run overnight my best unsupervised AWGN model and check it looks the same as the spuervised line from 6a, plot it the same etc.\n",
